### [Best practices for teams. GIT _(Article)_](https://opensource.com/article/20/7/git-best-practices):

- GIT convention for the team should be formalized
- Rebase feature branch often
  ```
  git checkout master
  git pull
  git checkout feature-xyz  # name of your hypothetical feature branch
  git rebase master  # may need to fix merge conflicts in feature-xyz
  ```
- Squash commits before merging. In general, there should only be one or a few commits added to master from each feature
  branch. To achieve this, squash multiple commits into one or a handful of commits with more elaborate messages for
  each one.
  ```
  git rebase -i HEAD~20  # look at up to 20 commits to consider squashing
  ```
- Use tags to preserve the current state as a significant milestone. While a branch accumulates a history of changes
  corresponding to commits, a tag is a snapshot of the branch's state at that instant. A tag can be thought of as a
  history-less branch or as a named pointer to a specific commit immediately before the tag was created.

### [The life-changing magic of git rebase -i _(Article)_](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/git-rebase-i)

- `--interactive` (or -i for short) flag to git rebase
- The flag allows you to make sophisticated changes to revision history while doing a rebase.
- Options are:
    - `Pick` maintains the commit in your history (default option).
    - `Reword` allows you to change a commit message, perhaps to fix a typo or add additional commentary.
    - `Edit` allows you to make changes to the commit while in the process of replaying the branch.
    - `Squash` merges multiple commits into one.
